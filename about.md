Hello! My name is Won Dong Jae, a Computer Science student at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong. I will be graduating this year with the Bachelor's
Degree of CS officially at the end of July.

My main interests lie in developing applications and games, and revolve
more towards the practical aspects of development. I like to see the changes
I make as I go.

Currently, I am looking for a job internationally, as I have just
finished my curriculum and awaiting for my official graduation. I would
love to start off work as a software developer.

Over my college years, I have taken part in various projects which have
involved developing mobile applications and other group-oriented research projects.

Please feel free to check out some of the work I have done over my college
years, and my CV if you are interested in discussing any working positions
with me :).
