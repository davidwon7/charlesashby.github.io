An Android application that helps regulate your physical & mental fitness.
Worked on this final year project for a year under a college professor at CUHK.

Will be released on Google Play later on!

### Objective
To create an Android application that can automatically
retrieve physical data & mental data from the user.

The data would then be translated into analytics for the user to view!

### Tools Used
- Worked with Java (Android), XML, Android Studio
- Google Play Services Framework + Google Fit API
- SQLite Database

### Accomplishments
- Worked with two other group mates to design this application.
- Implemented the Android version, while the other group implemented the iOS version.
- Worked on every phase of software development, from research to
implementation
- Learned Android programming using Android Studio from scratch
- Utilized many different libraries to improve the user interface

### Lessons Learned
- First time learning Android programming
- Learned the importance of user interface design, and the reasons behind
each element of UI
- How to work with other teammates on a conceptual level (implementation was
    done by me).
- A very fun, yet busy experience in which I learned how to deal with heavy
pressure from the professor and coursework.
