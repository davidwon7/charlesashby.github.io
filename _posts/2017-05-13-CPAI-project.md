A web application for users to take the Cross-cultural Personality Assessment
Inventory (CPAI). Measures user's personality and thoughts relative to surroundings.
Also part of my final year project (FYP).

### Objective
Our team was approached by the psychology department of CUHK, and were asked to
implement a program that could facilitate the CPAI test taking procedure.

It was done on pen/paper, and they wanted us to convert it into "digital" form (mouse clicks).

NOTE: There was already an existing quiz-application, and we modified it to
fit the requirements of the CPAI. We did not start from scratch, but we modified
the code after studying the application called KEEPository.

### Tools Used
- Angular JS, MySQL DB, PHP  
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Mozilla Firefox for testing, VIM for editing

### Accomplishments
- Modified the front-end part of the application, including UI
- Added some extra non-existent functionalities e.g. randomizing question order, navigation
- Communicated with group about backend modifications, and changed front-end accordingly.
- Met up with Dr. Yuen Wan Ho, the CPAI representative, to fulfill her requests.
- Learned some web-development languages for the first time (e.g. AngularJS)

### Lessons Learned
- It was a great experience working with a client, as it was very practical.
- Learning another application's code is harder than I preconceived, but it was
very meaningful.
- Worked alongside my Wellness and Health Mobile App, which improved my time-management skills.
