title: Installment 02 - Generative Adversarial Network
---

##### Introduction

This is the second and final installment for the project on conditional 
image generation. In this post, I present architectures that 
achieved much better reconstruction then autoencoders and run several experiments 
to test the effect of captions on the generated images.

The proposed models are variants of the generative adversarial 
network [7], I begin by introducing a vanilla Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) [1]
and then move on to the new Boundary Equilibrium GAN (BEGAN) 
architecture [2].

I also gave a shot at Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) [4], but unlike [Louis Henri Frank's](https://github.com/louishenrifranc/ImageFilling), my results were quite disappointing, had time not
been an issue it would have been interesting to take a look at the [Improved training of Wasserstein GANs paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf) [5], but implementing it in Theano proved to be quite hard.

##### Implementation Detail

The first model I explored is a standard generative adversarial 
network taken from [Philip Paquette's blog](https://github.com/ppaquette/ift-6266-project/),
the following figure illustrates it's architecture.

available [here](https://github.com/charlesashby/conditional-image-generation).**</sup>

The generator is composed of an encoder which is a smaller version
of the SqueezeNet architecture [3] and a decoder made up of multiple
strided transposed convolutions while the discriminator is a simple
encoder.

Both the generator and discriminator were trained simultaneously for 100
epochs using Adam optimizer, dropout was added at the middle of training and I also used 
feature matching to the generator's objective which really helped it learn better
reconstruction features.

##### Data Augmentation

I did not perform much data augmentation, images were simply randomly rotated once in a while,
from my "experiments", it is not clear at all if this trick helped the model generate better images. 

##### Caption Encoding

I decided to encode the captions using a pretrained skip-thought model [6], this network learns,
in an unsupervised way, a vector representation that preserves the syntactic and semantic properties
of the sentences it encodes.

##### Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network
In the BEGAN framework, the discriminator is an autoencoder. The objective function is 
a minimax game but,unlike standard GANs, the generator tries to minimize the reconstruction
error of the images it provides to the discriminator while the discriminator wants 
to simultaneously maximize this error and minimize the reconstruction error of the true 
images. The following figure gives a summary of this architecture.

The BEGAN model is based on the assumption that the reconstruction error of an 
autoencoder follows a normal distribution, when it is the case we can compute the
Wasserstein distance between them relatively easily.

Let $ L(v) = |v - D(v)| $ be the reconstruction error of some image $ v $, if $ L(X) \sim N(m_1, C_1) $ 
and $ L(G(z)) \sim N(m_2, C_2) $ then the Wasserstein distance between the true image reconstruction 
and the fake image reconstruction is given by

$$
W(L(X), L(G(z))^2 = \parallel m_1 - m_2 \parallel^2 + (C_1 + C_2 - 2\sqrt{C_1 C_2}) 
$$

Therefore, if $ \dfrac{C_1 + C_2 - 2 \sqrt{C_1 C_2}}{\parallel m_1 - m_2 \parallel^2} $ is constant or
monotonically increasing $ W(L(X), L(G(z))^2 \propto \parallel m_1 - m_2 \parallel^2 $, thus, we can 
maximize this equation by minimizing $m_1$ (which is equivalent to autoencoding the real images) and 
maximizing $m_2$.

The BEGAN objective is then given by:


$$
\left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        L_D = L(X) - L(G(z))  \\
        L_G = L(G(z)) 
    \end{array}
\right.

$$


Which is almost the same as the regular GAN (and WGAN), note that we don't need 
the Lipschitz conditions like in Wasserstein GAN [4],
therefore, we can train the generator and discriminator simultaneously,
we recover the ability to use optimizers with momentum and we don't have to 
clip the weights.

Training a BEGAN resulted in many failed attempts so I decided to compile a small
list of what worked best for me:

- No batchnorm in the encoders
- No ReLU/Leaky ReLU activation, exponential linear unit (ELU) seemed to work better
- No activation function in the decoders output; instead clip the values between [-1, 1]
- Do not use an autoencoder with too big capacity (e.g. SqueezeNet) for the discriminator
- Penalizing the generator with the L2 distance between the generated samples and the true
 images really helped stabilize training but resulted in square artefacts. (This one significantly helped
 when both the generator and discriminator had similar capacity, but not so much when the generator was stronger.)
- Using SqueezeNet as the encoder for the generator achieved slightly better results, and without the need for 
 L2 distance (unfortunately, I did not have time to test if adding it would improve my results).

##### Convergence Measure

One of the main frustration I had with generative adversarial networks is that the loss of it's objective function
does not mean anything in terms of image quality (or even convergence), therefore, training is usually very hard and unstable. 

In the BEGAN paper the authors come up with a convergence measure $ M_{global} = L(X) + \mid \gamma L(X) - L(G(z)) \mid $ where $\gamma$ is a hyperparameter between zero and one. The following plot shows that this convergence measure is well
correlated with image quality, we can also notice that convergence is quite quick.

with image quality.**</sup>


##### Results

In most cases, the pictures generated by my GAN and BEGAN were mostly of the same quality, however, when it came
to generating any kind of faces, BEGAN did much better, from the experiments I ran, the hardest pictures to generate
were faces and especially when something covered it slightly (in this case, both approach failed miserably).
