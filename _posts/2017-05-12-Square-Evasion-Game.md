The very first game I created in my own free time. Done on Unity2D. Main
objective is to dodge the incoming squares by using your hand. It is available
on [Google Play HERE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SimpleGames.Evasion).

### Objective
To learn Unity on my own time, and to practice my Unity C# skills and knowledge.
Also to publish my first game on Google Play.

### Tools Used
- Unity2D
- C# Unity
- Google Play

### Accomplishments
- Learned the basics of Unity
- Designed the game, and implemented using C#

### Lessons Learned
- Since it was my first time, it was very intriguing to see my game work on
my mobile phone
- I also learned that it is not easy to make a game, as it requires creativity.
- It is easy to put my game into the market, but very difficult to make it noticeable.
